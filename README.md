# HR_Attrition_Analysis

**HR Attrition Analysis and Visualization using Tableau and Excel**

**Overview:**
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition within the organization using HR data from two Excel files, namely HR_1 and HR_2. The dataset contained multiple columns such as Employee ID, Monthly Income, OverTime, Performance Rating, Years at Company, and more.

**Aim of the project:**
1. Analyze Attrition Rates: Investigate and understand the factors contributing to attrition within the organization.
2. Data Cleaning: Cleanse and preprocess HR data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. Strategic Insights: Extract actionable insights from the data to inform HR strategies and decision-making.
4. Data Optimization: Upload and manage HR data on MySQL for efficient data retrieval and analysis.
5. Visual Data Exploration: Utilize advanced visualizations in Tableau to explore relationships between variables and uncover trends that may impact attrition.

**Project Steps:**

**-Data Cleaning:** I started by cleaning the raw data using Excel, addressing errors, null values, and inconsistencies. This process ensured that the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis.

**-Data Analysis:** Utilizing Excel's functionalities, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the HR data. This involved calculating key statistics and generating various metrics.

**-Excel Dashboard:** I created an interactive dashboard using Excel that showcased crucial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs included average age, total employee count, attrition rate, average salary, and attrition rate based on different factors like years since last promotion, business travel categories, department, marital status, and more. Slicers for gender and department allowed users to filter the data dynamically.

**-Tableau Visualization:** To enhance the analysis, I used Tableau to create a more sophisticated dashboard. This platform allowed for advanced visualizations and exploration of relationships between different variables. KPIs in this dashboard included attrition, total employees, average age, average salary, average working years by department, job role vs. work-life balance, and more.

**-Data Optimization:** To improve data accessibility and retrieval, I uploaded the cleaned and analyzed data to a MySQL server. This step optimized data management, making it easier to perform further analyses and queries.
